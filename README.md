# API Weather Dashboard

## Description
Using [Openweather.org's](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) five-day forecast API, I created an app that lets you track the current weather as well as the five-day weather forecast for any city. Simply input a city name and view the results. 

The development taught me a lot about how to use APIs, how to grab and display data from the API onto my webpage, and the importance of defining variables in the proper scope and calling functions in the right places.
